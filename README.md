## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a programmer obsessed with efficiency. I love creating my own tools because I feel that existing ones are too generic and not precise enough.

I love Linux and open-source, I love doing projects that solve real problems.

**WasAlexis/wasalexis** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m not currently working, if you want to hire me, I am available.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, C/C++, Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to work at big tech companies.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my future projects.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
   - **My personal email is** alexisnomain@icloud.com

- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to share my knowledge, I am good at explaining topics and leading, but people think I am angry. I am not angry.

My profile has some tools I created myself. Feel free to clone it, use it, improve it, and share it.
